# Two Rooms and a Boom - Role Distributor

## Welcome to the virtual version of "Two Rooms and a Boom"
This is a platform to distribute player roles for the game **Two Rooms and a BOOM** via email.
*This is NOT an actual platform for the game itself.*

## How Does This Work?
The game is meant to be played in person or virtually through a video conference call application like Facetime or Zoom.
(But you'll need to figure out how to share cards)

When you run the 'main.py' application, the program will go through the 'contact.csv' file and send an email containing the player's role and a jpeg of their card. 

### Requirements
* 'python3' installed on your machine
* 'two_rooms' repo downloaded

### Instructions:
1. Edit the 'contact.csv' file to include each in the format '<name>,<email>' 
  (We recommend a Google Form for to get contact info)
1. Edit 'main.py': Look for the variable 'sender_email' and set it to the gmail address you widh to send emails from
1. Make sure that [allow less secure apps](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) is ON
  (You might want to make a new gmail account for this since this is a security issue)
1. Run 'python3 main.py' from your terminal in the 'two_rooms' directory

## Misc
You can use this script to distribute roles via SMS. To do this, we use cell providers' [SMS gateways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_gateway#Email_clients), so you will need to know the recipients' cell provider and number. The contact can then be added to 'contact.csv' in the form '<number>@<gateway>'
  Ex: The number 1 (999) 123-4567 provideed by verizon would be '9991234567@vtext.com'
